# Globitek Pentesting

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

## Blue

**Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi),** in the "id" querystring in the public-facing salesman page. [Demo](https://github.com/evandixon2/globitek-pentesting/blob/master/blue1.gif)

**Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation.** [Demo](https://github.com/evandixon2/globitek-pentesting/blob/master/blue2.gif)


## Green

**Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration.** The "Log in was unsuccessful" message is bold if the username exists, and normal if it does not. Other sites have the message bold all the time. [Demo](https://github.com/evandixon2/globitek-pentesting/blob/master/green1.gif)

**Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),** in the message body of the contact form, executed when a staff member reads feedback. [Demo](https://github.com/evandixon2/globitek-pentesting/blob/master/green2.gif)


## Red

**Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR).** The other sites redirect back to the salesman index page if a salesman ID doesn't exist or the salesman isn't assigned to any terriroties. [Demo](https://github.com/evandixon2/globitek-pentesting/blob/master/red1.gif)

**Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), ** no CSRF token is needed to update metadata, and can be completely absent from the request. Malicious code, such as what's in "totallySafeSoftwareGuide.htm" can be used to update desired data. [Demo](https://github.com/evandixon2/globitek-pentesting/blob/master/red2.gif)
