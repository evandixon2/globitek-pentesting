# Globitek Pentesting

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

*Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi),* in the "id" querystring in the public-facing salesman page.

*Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation*


## Green

*Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration.* The "Log in was unsuccessful" message is bold if the username exists, and normal if it does not. Other sites have the message bold all the time.

*Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),* in the message body of the contact form, executed when a staff member reads feedback.


## Red

*Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR).* The other sites redirect back to the salesman index page if a salesman ID doesn't exist or the salesman isn't assigned to any terriroties.

*Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), * no CSRF token is needed to update metadata, and can be completely absent from the request. Malicious code, such as what's in "totallySafeSoftwareGuide.htm" can be used to update desired data.
